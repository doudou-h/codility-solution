## **[16. MaxNonoverlappingSegments](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/16-greedy_algorithms/max_nonoverlapping_segments/)**

### Question
Located on a line are N segments, numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose positions are given in arrays A and B. 
For each I (0 ≤ I < N) the position of segment I is from A[I] to B[I] (inclusive). 
The segments are sorted by their ends, which means that B[K] ≤ B[K + 1] for K such that 0 ≤ K < N − 1.

Two segments I and J, such that I ≠ J, are overlapping if they share at least one common point. In other words, A[I] ≤ A[J] ≤ B[I] or A[J] ≤ A[I] ≤ B[J].

We say that the set of segments is non-overlapping if it contains no two overlapping segments. 
The goal is to find the size of a non-overlapping set containing the maximal number of segments.

Given two arrays A and B consisting of N integers, returns the size of a non-overlapping set containing a maximal number of segments.

Constraints:
- `0 <= N <= 30,000`
- `0 <= A[i], B[i] <= 1,000,000,000`
- `A[I] ≤ B[I]`, for each I (0 ≤ I < N)
- `B[K] ≤ B[K + 1]`, for each K (0 ≤ K < N − 1)

### Solution

#### Python
```python
def solution(A, B):
    if not B: return 0
    ans, prev = 1, B[0]
    for i in range(1, len(B)):
        if A[i] > prev:
            ans += 1
            prev = B[i] 
    return ans
```

#### C++
```cpp
int solution(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B) {
    if(B.size() == 0) 
        return 0;
    int ans = 1, prev = B[0];
    for(unsigned i = 1; i < B.size(); ++i){
        if(A[i] > prev){
            ans++;
            prev = B[i];
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
