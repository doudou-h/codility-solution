## **[4. MaxCounters](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/max_counters/)**

### Question
You are given N counters, initially set to 0, and you have two possible operations on them:

- increase(X) − counter X is increased by 1,
- max counter − all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.

A non-empty array A of M integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:

- if A[K] = X, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
- if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.

Given an integer N and a non-empty array A consisting of M integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N, M <= 100,000`
- `1 <= A[i] <= N + 1`

### Solution
The idea is that only max value matters before the last max counter operation (no need to update the counter for each increase operation).

#### Python
```python
from collections import Counter
from itertools import groupby

def solution(N, A):
    lastmaxindex = len(A) - 1 - A[::-1].index(N + 1) if N + 1 in A else -1
    maxvalue = 0
    for k, g in groupby(A[:lastmaxindex + 1], key=lambda x: x != N + 1):
        if k: maxvalue += max(Counter(g).values())
    ans = [maxvalue] * N
    for k, v in Counter(A[lastmaxindex + 1:]).items():
        ans[k - 1] += v
    return ans
```
