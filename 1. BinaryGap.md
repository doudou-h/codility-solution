### Question
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.

Given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 2,147,483,647`

### Solution


#### Python
```python
from itertools import groupby

def solution(N):
    s = format(N, 'b')
    i, j = 0, len(s)-1
    while i < len(s) and s[i] == '0':
        i += 1
    while j >= 0 and s[j] == '0':
        j -= 1
    s = s[i:j+1]
    ans = 0
    for k, g in groupby(s):
        if k == '0':
            ans = max(ans, len(list(g)))
    return ans
```
