## **[1. BinaryGap](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/binary_gap/)**

### Question
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.

Given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 2,147,483,647`

### Solution


#### Python
Convert N to binary string; remove '0's from both ends; obtain the length of the longest binary gap.

```python
from itertools import groupby

def solution(N):
    s = format(N, 'b')
    i, j = 0, len(s)-1
    while i < len(s) and s[i] == '0':
        i += 1
    while j >= 0 and s[j] == '0':
        j -= 1
    s = s[i:j+1]
    ans = 0
    for k, g in groupby(s):
        if k == '0':
            ans = max(ans, len(list(g)))
    return ans
```

- Time complexity: **O(n)**
- Space complexity: **O(n)**

#### C++
Use a bit mask 1 to remove the ending '0's of the given number since a logical AND (&) between any number and 1 gives the least significant bit of the number.

```cpp
#include<algorithm>

int solution(int N) {
    while (!(N & 1))
        N >>= 1;
    
    int ans = 0, cnt = 0;
    while(N){
        if(N % 2 == 1){
            ans = std::max(ans, cnt);
            cnt = 0;
        }else{
            cnt += 1;
        }
        N >>= 1;
    }
    return ans;
}
```

- Space complexity: **O(1)**
