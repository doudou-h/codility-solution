## **[2. OddOccurrencesInArray](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/)**

### Question
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, 
and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.

Given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.

Constraints:
- `N` is an odd integer and `1 <= N <= 1,000,000`
- `1 <= A[i] <= 1,000,000,000`
- All but one of the values in A occur an even number of times

### Solution

#### Python
```python
def solution(A):
    ans = 0
    for num in A:
        ans ^= num
    return ans
```

#### C++
```cpp
int solution(vector<int> &A) {
    int ans = 0;
    for(int num : A)
        ans ^= num;
    return ans;
}
```
