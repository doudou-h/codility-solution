## **[99. ArrayInversionCount](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/99-future_training/array_inversion_count/)**

### Question
An array A consisting of N integers is given. An inversion is a pair of indexes (P, Q) such that P < Q and A[Q] < A[P].

Given an array A, computes the number of inversions in A, or returns âˆ’1 if it exceeds 1,000,000,000.

Constraints:
- `0 <= N <= 100,000`
- `-2,147,483,647 <= A[i] <= 2,147,483,647`

### Solution

#### Python

Below solution scores 100%. The detected time complexity is `O(Nlog(N))`. However, the actual overall time complexity is `O(N^2)` since each insertion takes `O(N)`.

```python
from bisect import bisect_right

def solution(A):
    B, ans = [], 0
    for i, a in enumerate(A):
        j = bisect_right(B, a)
        ans += i - j
        B.insert(j, a)
    return ans if ans <= 1000000000 else -1
```

- Time complexity: **O(N^2)**
- Space complexity: **O(N)**

#### C++
```cpp

```
