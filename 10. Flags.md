## **[10. Flags](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/10-prime_and_composite_numbers/flags/)**

### Question
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

A peak is an array element which is larger than its neighbours. More precisely, it is an index P such that 0 < P < N − 1 and A[P − 1] < A[P] > A[P + 1].

You are going on a trip to a range of mountains whose relative heights are represented by array A, as shown in a figure below. 
You have to choose how many flags you should take with you. The goal is to set the maximum number of flags on the peaks, according to certain rules.

Flags can only be set on peaks. What's more, if you take K flags, then the distance between any two flags should be greater than or equal to K. 
The distance between indices P and Q is the absolute value |P − Q|.

Given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of flags that can be set on the peaks of the array.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 400,000`
- `0 <= A[i] <= 1,000,000,000`

### Solution

#### Python
```python
def solution(A):
    def isvalid(K):
        if K == 1: return True
        prev, cnt = p[0], 1
        for i in range(1, len(p)):
            if p[i] - prev >= K:
                cnt += 1
                if cnt == K: return True
                prev = p[i]
        return False

    p = [i for i in range(1, len(A)-1) if A[i-1] < A[i] and A[i] > A[i+1]] # peaks
    if not p: return 0
    if isvalid(len(p)): return len(p)
    lo, hi = 1, len(p)
    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        if not isvalid(mid):
            hi = mid
        else:
            lo = mid + 1
    return lo - 1
```
