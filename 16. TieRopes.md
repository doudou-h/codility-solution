### Question
There are N ropes numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose lengths are given in an array A, lying on the floor in a line. 
For each I (0 ≤ I < N), the length of rope I on the line is A[I].

We say that two ropes I and I + 1 are adjacent. Two adjacent ropes can be tied together with a knot, 
and the length of the tied rope is the sum of lengths of both ropes. The resulting new rope can then be tied again.

For a given integer K, the goal is to tie the ropes in such a way that the number of ropes whose length is greater than or equal to K is maximal.

Given an integer K and a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of ropes of length greater than or equal to K that can be created.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 100,000`
- `1 <= K <= 1,000,000,000`
- `1 <= A[i] <= 1,000,000,000`

### Solution

#### Python
```python
def solution(K, A):
    ans, cur = 0, 0
    for a in A:
        if cur + a >= K:
            ans += 1
            cur = 0
        else:
            cur += a 
    return ans 
```

#### C++
```cpp
int solution(int K, vector<int> &A) {
    int ans = 0, cur = 0;
    for(int a : A){
        if(cur + a >= K){
            ans++;
            cur = 0;
        }else{
            cur += a;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
