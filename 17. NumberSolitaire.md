### Question
A game for one player is played on a board consisting of N consecutive squares, numbered from 0 to N − 1. 
There is a number written on each square. A non-empty array A of N integers contains the numbers written on the squares. 
Moreover, some squares can be marked during the game.

At the beginning of the game, there is a pebble on square number 0 and this is the only square on the board which is marked. 
The goal of the game is to move the pebble to square number N − 1.

During each turn we throw a six-sided die, with numbers from 1 to 6 on its faces, and consider the number K, 
which shows on the upper face after the die comes to rest. Then we move the pebble standing on square number I to square number I + K, 
providing that square number I + K exists. If square number I + K does not exist, we throw the die again until we obtain a valid move. 
Finally, we mark square number I + K.

After the game finishes (when the pebble is standing on square number N − 1), we calculate the result. 
The result of the game is the sum of the numbers written on all marked squares.

Given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximal result that can be achieved on the board represented by array A.

Constraints:
- `2 <= N <= 100,000`
- `-10,000 <= A[i] <= 10,000`

### Solution
Space complexity can be reduced to `O(1)` since only last six values are needed. Codility doesn't check space complexity so I keep my `O(n)` solution :)

#### Python
```python
def solution(A):
    def dp(n):
        if n in cache:
            return cache[n]
        res = -float('inf')
        for i in range(1, 7):
            if n - i < 0: break
            res = max(res, dp(n - i))
        cache[n] = res + A[n]
        return cache[n]

    cache = {0: A[0]}
    for n in range(len(A)): dp(n)
    return cache[len(A) - 1]
```

- Time complexity: **O(n)**
- Space complexity: **O(n)**

A short but DANGEROUS solution. See [sys.setrecursionlimit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setrecursionlimit)

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)

def solution(A):
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def f(n):
        if n == 0: return A[0]
        return max(f(n - i) + A[n] for i in range(1, min(7, n + 1)))
    return f(len(A)-1)
```


#### C++
```cpp
#include <climits>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

int dp(int n, const vector<int> &A, unordered_map<int, int> &m){
    if(m.find(n) != m.end())
        return m[n];
    int res = INT_MIN;
    for(int i = 1; i <= min(n, 6); ++i)
        res = max(res, dp(n - i, A, m));
    m[n] = res + A[n];
    return m[n];
}

int solution(vector<int> &A) {
    unordered_map<int, int> m = {{0, A[0]}};     
    for(int n = 0; n < A.size(); ++n)
        dp(n, A, m);
    return m[A.size()-1];
}
```

- Time complexity: **O(n)**
- Space complexity: **O(n)**
