## **[17. MinAbsSum](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/17-dynamic_programming/min_abs_sum/)**

### Question
For a given array A of N integers and a sequence S of N integers from the set {−1, 1}, we define val(A, S) as follows:

val(A, S) = |sum{ A[i]*S[i] for i = 0..N−1 }|
(Assume that the sum of zero elements equals zero)

Given an array A of N integers, 
computes the minimum value of val(A,S) from all possible values of val(A,S) for all possible sequences S of N integers from the set {−1, 1}.

Constraints:
- `0 <= N <= 20,000`
- `-100 <= A[i] <= 100`

### Solution

This question reminds me of [Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/). 
However, the dp solution inspired by the Refueling Stops question doesn't score 100% on performance. 

Below is the Golden solution from [Official Guide](https://codility.com/media/train/solution-min-abs-sum.pdf). 

#### Python
```python
from collections import Counter

def solution(A):
    A = list(abs(a) for a in A)
    S = sum(A)
    dp = [-1] * (S + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for a, cnt in Counter(A).items():
        for i in range(S + 1):
            if dp[i] >= 0:
                dp[i] = cnt
            elif i >= a and dp[i - a] > 0:
                dp[i] = dp[i - a] - 1
    return min(abs(2 * i - S) for i in range(len(dp)) if dp[i] >= 0)
```
