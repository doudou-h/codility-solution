## **[7. Nesting](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/7-stacks_and_queues/nesting/)**

### Question
A string S consisting of N characters is called properly nested if:

- S is empty;
- S has the form `(U)` where U is a properly nested string;
- S has the form `VW` where V and W are properly nested strings.

Given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if string S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 1,000,000`
- String S consists only of the characters `(` and/or `)`


### Solution

#### Python
```python
def solution(S):
    stack = []
    for c in S:
        if c == ')' and stack and stack[-1] == '(':
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(c)
    return 1 if not stack else 0
```

#### C++
```cpp
#include<stack>

int solution(string &S) {
    std::stack<char> s;
    for(char &c : S){
        if(c == ')' && s.size() > 0 && s.top() == '(')
            s.pop();
        else
            s.push(c);
    }
    return s.size() == 0 ? 1 : 0;
}
```
