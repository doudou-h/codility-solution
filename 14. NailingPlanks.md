## **[14. NailingPlanks](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/14-binary_search_algorithm/nailing_planks/)**

### Question
You are given two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers. These arrays represent N planks. 
More precisely, A[K] is the start and B[K] the end of the K−th plank.

Next, you are given a non-empty array C consisting of M integers. This array represents M nails. 
More precisely, C[I] is the position where you can hammer in the I−th nail.

We say that a plank (A[K], B[K]) is nailed if there exists a nail C[I] such that A[K] ≤ C[I] ≤ B[K].

The goal is to find the minimum number of nails that must be used until all the planks are nailed. 
In other words, you should find a value J such that all planks will be nailed after using only the first J nails. 
More precisely, for every plank (A[K], B[K]) such that 0 ≤ K < N, 
there should exist a nail C[I] such that I < J and A[K] ≤ C[I] ≤ B[K].

Given two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers and a non-empty array C consisting of M integers, 
returns the minimum number of nails that, used sequentially, allow all the planks to be nailed.

If it is not possible to nail all the planks, the function should return −1.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N, M <= 30,000`
- `1 <= A[i], B[i], C[i] <= 2 * M`
- `A[k] <= B[k]`

### Solution
`CI` stands for C and its elements' Indices lol

#### Python
```python
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

def solution(A, B, C):
    N, M = len(A), len(C)
    pairs = sorted(enumerate(C), key=lambda x : x[1]) 
    CI = [[x[1] for x in pairs], [x[0] for x in pairs]]
    ans = -1
    for i in range(N):
        l = bisect_left(CI[0], A[i])
        r = bisect_right(CI[0], B[i])
        if l == r: return -1
        res = float('inf')
        for j in range(l, r):
            if CI[1][j] <= ans:
                res = CI[1][j]
                break
            res = min(res, CI[1][j])
        ans = max(ans, res)
    return ans + 1
```
