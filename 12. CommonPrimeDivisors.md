## **[]()**

### Question
A prime is a positive integer X that has exactly two distinct divisors: 1 and X. The first few prime integers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13.

A prime D is called a prime divisor of a positive integer P if there exists a positive integer K such that D * K = P. For example, 2 and 5 are prime divisors of 20.

You are given two positive integers N and M. The goal is to check whether the sets of prime divisors of integers N and M are exactly the same.

Given two non-empty arrays A and B of Z integers, returns the number of positions K for which the prime divisors of A[K] and B[K] are exactly the same.

Constraints:
- `1 <= Z <= 6,000`
- `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2,147,483,647`

### Solution

#### Python
```python
from math import gcd
def solution(A, B):
    def f(n, m):
        while True:
            g = gcd(n, m)
            if g == 1:
                return n
            n //= g
    return sum(1 for i in range(len(A)) if f(A[i], gcd(A[i], B[i])) == 1 and f(B[i], gcd(A[i], B[i])) == 1)
```
