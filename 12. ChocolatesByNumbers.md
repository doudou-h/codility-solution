### Question
Two positive integers N and M are given. Integer N represents the number of chocolates arranged in a circle, numbered from 0 to N − 1.

You start to eat the chocolates. After eating a chocolate you leave only a wrapper.

You begin with eating chocolate number 0. Then you omit the next M − 1 chocolates or wrappers on the circle, and eat the following one.

More precisely, if you ate chocolate number X, then you will next eat the chocolate with number (X + M) modulo N (remainder of division).

You stop eating when you encounter an empty wrapper.

Given two positive integers N and M, returns the number of chocolates that you will eat.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N, M <= 1,000,000,000`

### Solution

#### Python
```python
from math import gcd
def solution(N, M):
    return N // gcd(M, N)
```
